# Heart disease prediction

This project consisted on predicting heart disease from patients' medical attributes, such as type of chest pain, cholesterol levels and blood pressure.

Throughout we took the following steps:
- Loading and exploring the data;
- Modelling the data with several classifiers;
- Tuning hyperparameters;
- Evaluating the model;
- Saving the model.

This project was written in Python and uses Python tools, such as Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.


## Explanation of files

The data is contained in `heart-disease.csv` and it is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci.

The file `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook containing the project analysis and report.

The tuned classification model, for predicting whether a patient has heart disease, is saved in `tuned_log_reg_model_1.pkl`.
